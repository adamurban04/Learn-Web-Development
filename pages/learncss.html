    <h2>CSS</h2>

    <p>Cascading Style Sheets is the butter to HTMl's bread when it comes to web development.</p>
    <p>Here is an introductory video:

<p> <span> An easy way of describing web development would be to think of HTML as the ingredients used to
bake a cake and CSS as the way in which the baker styles the cake. </span></p>
</p>
<p> The <b>3 key attributes</b> to successful use of css are: 

    <ol>

      <li>Selectors and Specitivity</li>
      <div class="explaintxt">
      <p>Knowing how to effectively select HTML elements using CSS selectors is fundamental. <br>
        This includes understanding different types of selectors and their uses, such as class selectors, element selectors, and ID selectors.</p>
     
    </div>

    <li>Layout techniques</li>
      <div class="explaintxt">
      <p>Understanding the layout technique involes learning how to properly arrange items on a webpage.<br>
        This is most commonly done using a box model, in which width, border, and margin are specified to create a box which an item will be displayed in.<br>
         Alongside this, padding can be used to add distance between items on a webpage in the top, bottom, left or right direction (such as images or paragraphs).</p>
     
    </div>

    <li>Responsive design</li>
      <div class="explaintxt">
      <p>Understanding Responsive design styling is critical in building a website that is fun and intresting for the user to interact with.<br>
        For example, you can make text change color when hovered using the hover css function, or have a button or link make a noise when interacted with.<br>
        (though this is often harder and may involve the use of javascript depending on the level of complication)

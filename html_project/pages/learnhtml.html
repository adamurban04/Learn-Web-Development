    <h2>HTML</h2>

    <p>Hypertext Markup Language is the center pillar of web development.</p>
    <p>Here is an introductory video:</p>
      
      <video width="620" height="360" controls>
        <source src="../videos/html.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.

     <div class="par">
        <p> <span>As you can see, html is very important and can often seem complicated.</span></p>
        <p> Here are the <b>5 most important attributes</b> to grasp the basics of in order to succeed in html web development:</p>

        <ol>

          <li>Document structure</li>
          <div class="explaintxt">
          <p>Document structure is an integral part of effective web development with html.<br>
            A html website will generally contain the declarations of html, head, and body.
          </p>
        </div>



        <li>Elements and tags</li>
        <div class="explaintxt">
          <p>Elements and tags are another fundamental part of html web development.<br>
             These are used to describe what category the information being input to the website is.  <br>          
             For example h1 would denote a header, ul and li denote lists, audio denotes audio and so forth.
          </p>
        </div>

        <li>Attributes</li>
        <div class="explaintxt">
          <p> Attributes are also an integral part of html web development.<br>
             They allow for styling, unique identification and other extremly helpful utilities such as hyperlinks.<br>
            Common attributes used are class for styling, id for identification, src for specifying the source of an item, and href for hyperlinks.
          </p>
        </div>

        <li>Forms and input elements</li>
        <div class="explaintxt">
          <p> Form elements are a bit advanced, however are extremly useful for creating an interactive website.<br>
            Examples of these input elements include checkboxes, text fields and submit buttons, all of which can be used to build a functional and engaging website.
          </p>
        </div>

        <li>Semantic HTML</li>
        <div class="explaintxt">
          <p> Proper use of semantic HTML can also seem confusing and tough, but really all it entails is keeping your declerations clear and concise.<br>
            For example, labling sections and classes by use instead of random letters, using footers to articulate code, and using navbars and articles in order to keep
            the end user expierence clean and enjoyable.
          </p>
